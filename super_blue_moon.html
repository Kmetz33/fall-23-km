        <h2>What is the Super Blue Moon</h2>
        <p>
            The Super Blue Moon is not what we would expect. 
            It is not a blue moon at all. 
            What this refers to is when a full Moon happens back to back. 
            For example, on the 29th to the 31st we have a trifecta of full moons. 
            This is known as a full moon, a supermoon, and a blue moon. 
            The Moon travels in an elliptical orbit and when it is at it's nearest point to Earth, this is called a "Supermoon". 
            The Moon doesn't necessarily turn blue, but it is a little bit closer than usual and appears large and bright in the sky.

            If you have the opportunity to look at this spectical please do. 
            About 25 percent of all full moons are supermoons, but only 3 percent of full moons are blue moons.
            Have no fear if you miss it though, the times between super blue moons is irregular, roughly 10 years but can be as long as 20 years.
            We wont be due for another until 2037, so sit tight.
